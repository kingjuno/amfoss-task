# Task - 07
## Ubiquitous UI

This was my most favourite task in the whole set.<br>
It was little difficult though.
<br><br>
After setting up flutter I started watching some youtube videos and found how to create app and after that i also learned how use pageview function (so i used that instead of tabs but I later figured tabs where way more easier).<br>
Then I proceeded with image insertion and some other features like bottomSheet....<br>
The first problem was I was totally messed up figuring out how to position image and that was solved after when I knew about stack widget.<br>
It was easier to setup animated dots and then I had to spend a little to figure out how i can make the image move as like in task.<br>
To solve that I used a variable to set position of image so I could modify position after each page scrolling.
And ig I have done the tasks XD.

I really thank @chromicle for helping me in my need.

Note :
I dont know whether this resize according to screen size.
