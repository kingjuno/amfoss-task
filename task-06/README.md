# Task 06
## Geddit 

This was  hard. I used to different go packages (one was given in the question and the other I found while I was searching).                                          
### Packages
1- https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit
2- https://github.com/jzelinskie/geddit

2nd package was used because there were some problem for fetching the subreddit that occurs as the first search result.
I used the 1st package for upvoting.
