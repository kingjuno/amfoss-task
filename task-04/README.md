# Task 04
## Debugging Derbies

This was an easy task as there were some quite few syntax error and some others....<br>
Just completing statements with ; and changing one button name was enough.<br>
Even though not that familiar with java  I just compiled the filed in my terminal and found there were some error and since compilation showed where errors where it became a lot easier to debug the code without knowing much and without doing an analyze of code.
