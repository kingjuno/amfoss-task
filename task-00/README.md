## Installing Ubuntu

I was already using ubuntu for several years and usually I don't use windows.
I have already tried kali-linux ,linux mint and raspbian for PC's and also raspberry pi.
I have used Gnome,KDE and someother stuffs which i don't remember now. But GNOME is always my favouite one.
I think I used RUFUS for creating the bootable USB.
