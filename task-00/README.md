## Installing Ubuntu

- I was already using ubuntu for seven years (we had ubuntu in our curriculum) and usually I don't use windows .
- I have already tried various distro's like kali-linux ,linux mint,parrot OS and raspbian for PC's and also raspberry pi.
- I usually use RUFUS for creating the bootable USB.
