## Installing Ubuntu

- I was already using ubuntu for several years and usually I don't use windows.
- I have already tried kali-linux ,linux mint,parrot OS and raspbian for PC's and also raspberry pi.
- I have used Gnome,KDE and someother stuffs which i don't remember now. But GNOME is always my favouite one cause its better than KDE atleast for me.(I haven't used KDE for a long time(~2 years I guess) so I am not pretty sure if it's awesome).
- I think I used RUFUS for creating the bootable USB.
