# Task 13
## Circuit Design

Task was an easy one.
First I did that using drag and drop and learned how things/components do there work.<br>So after that I did the same by coding them in tinkercad.
<br>
I learned using ultrasonic sound sensors and working of arduino from instructables and from arduino official site.<br>

So for the project to represent when object lies at a position less than 100cm along with motor i used a bulb to indicate the circuit is working as i cant show the rotary motion of motor.
