# Task 13
## Circuit Design

Task was an easy one.
First I did that using drag and drop and learned how things/components do their work.<br>So after that I did the same by coding them in tinkercad.
<br>
I learned using ultrasonic sound sensors and working of arduino from instructables and from arduino official site.<br>
Coding was not difficult because i already have done so many Raspberry Pi projects and the code structure was somewhat looking similar atleast for my case. (not the syntax but the way we deals the pins in arduino seems somewhat similar to GPIO in raspberry)<br><br>


So for the project to represent when object lies at a position less than 100cm along with motor i used a bulb to indicate the circuit is working as i cant show the rotary motion of motor.
