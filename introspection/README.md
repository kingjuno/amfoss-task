# Introspection

## Why we must you?
  - So I really have a good CS background and have been programming for around 5 years.
  - Right now i am familiar with C++,python,javascript,SQL and also I am familiar with github(from cmd line too..)
  - I like coding so much and spend most the free time with coding and learning new language's.
  - I like helping other people's while I am also a guy who annoy's everyone if i see a problem that seems to be lil more than hard.
 
## What is your plan for next 6 months?
  - I would like to do some android development eventhough i havent made an app in android studio I have created some applications in sketchware and appybuilder 
  - I would like to learn java and kotlin maybe golang to.
  - I would be doing projects in different field and need to find out which field suits me more.
 
## How would you contribute back to the club? 
  - I will impart whatever knowledge I have and seems to be useful for others.
  - Also give my maximum support to every members in their need.
  
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
  - Selection process is awesome but i wish i would have been in the bulbasaur section(my favourite one)...But still my helpers Sev(Ananthan) and DE_BLANK_(sevagen) were 
  so nice that they were willing to help whenever there was a need.
  - It was pretty good if there was a leaderboard like the team bi0s since this would boost productivity of some curious minds.
  
  Anyway I wish I would be a foss member.
