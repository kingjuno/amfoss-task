 I really thank the amFOSS members for presenting a nice contest in Hackerrank.                                                               
 Questions were awesome.                                                                                                                                            
 For some question's TLE (timeout)was a big problem since optimising the solution was also a boring job cause i had to change the entire code for pizza fest :) .
 Pizza fest was some medium difficult since i have to use map vectors and others were somewhat easier.
