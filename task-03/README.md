 I really thank the amFOSS members for presenting a nice contest in Hackerrank.                                                               
 Questions were awesome.                                                                                                                                            
 For some question's TLE (timeout)was a big problem since optimising the solution was a boring job. for eg: i had to change the entire code for pizza fest :) .<br>
 Pizza fest was some medium difficult since i had to use map vectors.<br>Others were easy.
